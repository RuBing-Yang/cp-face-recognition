# PyTorch Image Retrieval  
A PyTorch framework for an image retrieval task including implementation of [N-pair Loss (NIPS 2016)](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6199-improved-deep-metric-learning-with-multi-class-n-pair-loss-objective) and [Angular Loss (ICCV 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.01682.pdf).

### Loss functions
We implemented loss functions to train the network for image retrieval.  
Batch sampler for the loss function borrowed from [here](https://github.com/adambielski/siamese-triplet).

### Self-attention module
We attached the self-attention module of the [Self-Attention GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08318) to conventional classification networks (e.g. DenseNet, ResNet, or SENet).  
Implementation of the module borrowed from [here](https://github.com/heykeetae/Self-Attention-GAN).

### Data augmentation
We adopted data augmentation techniques used in [Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325).

### Post processing
We utilized the following post-processing techniques in the inference phase.
- Moving the origin of the feature space to the center of the feature vectors
- L2-normalization
- [Average query expansion](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/papers/chum07b.pdf)
- [Database-side feature augmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.07940.pdf)
